# Welcome to my Bookstore Website Project

This is a school project I did for my Database class. It currently only works in localhost. Since it has a database attached to it, additional configuration will need to be added if I wanted to use it with github pages for example using API's to transfer information between the PostgreSQL server and github pages. I have included the website code and the SQL queries for anyone to recreate this website and database. In order for it to work with a database, I used XAMPP to create localhost Apache webserver, and psql shell in the terminal to run the queries and create the database.
